# Universal Precision Cutting Jig – Fully Configurable
 
This is a high-performance, fully parametric cutting jig designed to provide professional-grade precision for manual sawing. Unlike fixed-size jigs, this tool is completely configurable to accommodate timber, profiles, or square axes of any dimension.

 

Whether you need a perfect 90° square cut or a precise 45° miter joint, this jig acts as a rigid guide to eliminate blade wandering and ensure repeatable results across your entire project.

## Key Features
- Fully Parametric Design: Easily adjust the width, length, and height to match the specific stock you are working with.
- Multi-Angle Support: Dedicated slots for both 90° and 45° cuts, providing versatility for everything from basic framing to fine cabinetry.
- Integrated Clamping System (my custom changes): Features a customized section with locking screw threads. This allows you to tighten the jig directly onto the workpiece, ensuring it remains rock-solid during the cut for maximum safety and accuracy.
- Print-in-Place Efficiency: Designed to be printed with minimal or no supports, even with the integrated screw threads.
 

## Technical Specs
- Customizable Gap: Set the guide slot width to match your specific hand saw blade thickness for "zero-clearance" precision.
- Reinforced Guide Walls: Thick sidewalls provide maximum surface area to keep the saw blade perfectly vertical.

 

## Print Settings
- Material: PLA+ or PETG for better durability and thread strength.
- Walls: 4-6 walls (Crucial for the strength of the screw threads and guide walls).
- Infill: 25% Gyroid or Honeycomb for structural rigidity.
- Layer Height: 0.28mm for a good balance between print speed and thread precision.

 

## How to Use
1. Configure: Input your workpiece dimensions into the provided OpenSCAD script.
1. Cut: Use the 90° or 45° slots to guide your saw for a perfect finish.
